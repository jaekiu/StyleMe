# StyleMe :shirt::jeans:
###### Created by Jacqueline Zhang and Sahil Sanghvi for CalHacks 5.0

### Introduction
We all have those days when we wake up and don't know what to wear. We want to be stylish, but we also don't have the time to stand there and contemplate about what tops would pair well with certain bottoms. In order to help reduce the indecisive moments we have regarding our outfit choices, **StyleMe** automatically generates outfit choices based on **items in your wardrobe** and environmental factors such as the **weather**.

### How Does This Work

### Awards
In November 2018, StyleMe was tied for 1st place in the IBM API Challenge for CalHacks 5.0!

### What's Next?
Sahil and I have many floating ideas that we would **LOVE** to implement and/or expand on for StyleMe. Some of our ideas include, but are not limited to:
* Turning it into a web application (potentially through Meteor)
* Retraining the classifier to be more specific (fabrics, hooded vs non-hooded jackets, etc.)
* User being able to input an occassion and filtering outfits based on criteria related to that occassion
* Implementing a bot that reads the latest fashion trends and using that information to create stylish outfits
* Shopping recommendations based on what the user currently has in his/her wardrobe
